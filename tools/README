Note...

But some of these tools are actually from other related things, such as OSCE certification, SLAE certification, etc.

After all, OSCE certification would never been possible without SLAE, Vulnserver, etc.

So consider this my unofficial OSCE repository.  Because can't really share any of that stuff without risking losing the certification itself, due to Offsec terms and conditions, RE: Student ethics.

SO, for obvious reasons, not sharing any solutions to any of the CTP lab or OSCE certification.
