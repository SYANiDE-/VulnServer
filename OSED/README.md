VulnServer solutions and tooling (OSED refix)

All of my solutions for VulnServer, in preparation for the OSED Offensive Security Exploit Development certification (Circa 2023)

CTP/OSCE was taken back in 2018, python2, fuzzing and EDB/Ollydbg.

WUMED/OSED is the new new new shit, python3, reverse engineering with static and dynamic code analysis, WinDBG, IDA Pro.

```
STATS [stat_value]      ; not_exploitable
RTIME [rtime_value]     ; not_exploitable
LTIME [ltime_value]     ; not_exploitable
SRUN [srun_value]       ; not_exploitable
TRUN [trun_value]       ; exploitable
GMON [gmon_value]       ; exploitable
GDOG [gdog_value]       ; not_exploitable
KSTET [kstet_value]     ; exploitable
GTER [gter_value]       ; exploitable
HTER [hter_value]       ; exploitable
LTER [lter_value]       ; exploitable
KSTAN [lstan_value]     ; not_exploitable
```

Honestly for the most part, each solution found in the "exploitable" folder is impressive in some way or another.  Some more than others.  Honorable mentions to KSTET, GTER, and LTER.
